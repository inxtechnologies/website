          <h2>4. Gmail API Usage</h2>
          <p>INX Technologies uses the Gmail API as part of our automation infrastructure. Gmail access is required for automation workflows that send enquiry confirmations and operational emails on behalf of client businesses.</p>

            <li>Send automated confirmation emails to individuals who submit enquiries through our clients' systems.</li>
            <li>Send operational notification emails as part of automated business workflows.</li>
            <li>The application does not access or read email content unless explicitly enabled for a specific client automation configuration.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>INX Technologies accesses Gmail data only to the extent necessary to perform the automation services agreed upon with our clients. We do not use Gmail data for advertising, profiling, or any purpose unrelated to the contracted automation services.</p>
          <p>Our use of information received from Google APIs adheres to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Google API Services User Data Policy</u></a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>

          <h2>5. Sheets and Drive API Usage</h2>
          <p>INX Technologies uses the Google Sheets API to securely store enquiry form data in a spreadsheet, and the Google Drive API (drive.file scope) solely to access and manage the specific spreadsheet files required for this purpose.</p>
          <p>The application does not access or manage any other files in the user’s Google Drive.</p>
          <p>Our use of information received from Google APIs adheres to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Google API Services User Data Policy</u></a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Google APIs:</strong> Including Gmail API for email automation workflows. Usage is governed by Google's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</li>
            <li><strong>Email service providers:</strong> For sending automated communications on behalf of client businesses.</li>
            <li><strong>Hosting providers:</strong> For hosting automation infrastructure and client websites.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We ensure that all third-party integrations comply with applicable data protection standards and are used solely for the purpose of delivering our contracted services.</p>

          <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
          <p>INX Technologies implements appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the data we process. These measures include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Encrypted data transmission using HTTPS/TLS protocols.</li>
            <li>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is enforced on administrative and backend systems, and secure authentication controls are implemented for all system access to enhance account security and help prevent unauthorized access.</li>
            <li>Access controls limiting data access to authorized personnel only.</li>
            <li>Regular review of security practices and infrastructure.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>While we take reasonable steps to protect data, no method of electronic transmission or storage is completely secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security but are committed to maintaining industry-standard protections.</p>

          <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
          <p>INX Technologies retains data only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes described in this policy or as required by applicable law. When data is no longer needed, it is securely deleted or anonymised.</p>
